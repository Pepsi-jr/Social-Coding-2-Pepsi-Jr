## Forking the repository
However, you'll need to learn how to fork this repository so that you can have your own copy to work off of.

**A tutorial can be found here:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12wZBzG4Hw

## Website setup
Next, you'll need to have atleast an .html document in order for your website to show.

Within the src folder, locate the apps folder, in the folder is where you'll put your folder containing your .html, css, or JavaScript doc.

This is an example of how a folder could look like.

## Adding the website
After adding your basic files, locate the navigation folder and find the index.js file

Within the file, you'll need to add:
* Name of the website
* Link to the file
* Author's Name

## Incentives
One thing that is different this social coding is that there are some issues that span from Easy to Hard difficulty! Take a shot at the issues!
What some contributers could do is help fix the website, and in return, earn __MOMOCOINS__ to spend.

**DISCLAIMER: AT THIS MOMENT, __MOMOCOINS__ HAVE NO VALUE BUT ARE GOOD TO EARN NONETHELESS. MIGHT BE USEFUL LATER**

| Difficulty | MOMOCOIN Value |
|------------|----------------|
| Easy       | 3 MOMOCOINS    |
| Medium     | 6 MOMOCOINS    |
| Hard       | 10 MOMOCOINS   |

### RULES
1. The issues will stay open until the contributions have ceased. After this, the issue will be closed and can no longer be attempted.
2. Being first doesn't mean you win. This is a collaboration issue and is open to anyone. Points will be distributed fairly.
3. Good luck and have fun!

## Resources
There are some resources that could help you out on building your website! It may also help you understand documentation!
